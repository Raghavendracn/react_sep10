## üéØ AI Assistant Master Prompts

### Complete Project Setup
```
"Create a production-ready React TypeScript application with Material-UI integration that includes:

1. Comprehensive MUI component showcase (AppBar, Cards, Forms, Lists, Themes)
2. ESLint configuration with no-console and no-debugger rules
3. Pre-commit hooks using Husky and lint-staged to prevent rule violations
4. VS Code settings for automatic code fixing and formatting
5. Complete TypeScript interfaces and proper type safety
6. Git repository setup with all configuration files
7. Team collaboration documentation

Ensure that no commits can be made with ESLint violations and provide step-by-step setup instructions for team members."
```

### ESLint Enforcement Setup
```
"Set up bulletproof ESLint enforcement for a React TypeScript project that:

1. Prevents console.log and debugger statements in production code
2. Blocks git commits containing ESLint violations
3. Auto-fixes issues in VS Code on save
4. Works consistently across all team members
5. Includes both package.json and standalone ESLint configurations

Provide complete configuration files and test the setup by attempting to commit code with violations."
```

### Team Collaboration Setup
```
"Configure a React TypeScript project for professional team collaboration with:

1. Consistent code quality standards using ESLint
2. Automated pre-commit hooks that prevent bad code from being committed
3. VS Code settings that work the same for all developers
4. Clear documentation for onboarding new team members
5. Git repository with all necessary configuration files

Ensure the setup is foolproof and works immediately after cloning the repository."
```

## üîç Verification Commands

```bash
# Test ESLint rules
npm start  # Should show errors for console.log/debugger

# Test pre-commit hooks
git add .
git commit -m "test"  # Should fail if violations exist

# Verify team setup
npm install  # Should set up hooks automatically
```
